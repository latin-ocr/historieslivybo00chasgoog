than Madvig ; no one is more competent to tell how
the great Roman authors ought to have written. It
is possible, however, that they did not always write
as wellas they ought. They had a share of the same
freedom of composition, and the same liability to
careless oversight, as our own writers, though in less
degree 3 and we must allow them, perhaps, an occa-
sional solecism. Furthermore-pooe tanti ciri dicente
—there are cases sometimes where a higher law than
formal grammatica] regularity rightly asserts itself,
and offence itself is glorious. But this by no means
in extenuation of the merite of the greatest of living
critics, and still less to cast upon him the slightest
imputation of narrow pedantry3 it is only my excuse
for daring sometimes to differ from one who has done
more for the emendation of the text of Livy than all
other scholars put together. Next to Madvig, I am
indebted for my text particularly to the editions of

Weissenborn, Hertz, and Alschefski. The grounds
of my preference among different readings have, in

⁸ some of the most important cases, been stated in the

notes, so far as the special purposes of this edition
seemed to permit.

As regards the forms of words,I have not hesi-
tated, in spite of the objections of sciolists, to adopt
for the most part that “ new orthography’' which is
theold. With Hertz, too, as well as after the great
example of Munro in his Lucretius, Ι have followed
the manuscripts to some extent in giving different
forms for the same‘word in different places. Munro
