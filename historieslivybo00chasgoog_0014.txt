contenda that such was the practice 01 the old writers
themselves, This course has some advantagos in an
edition designed for studente habituatcd iotha oon-
ventional orthography 01 the grammaticus, and 10
perhaps safest while some questions remain unsolved.
It 10 my conviction, however, that the final result 01 ⁴
scholarly investigation in this field will be the adop·
1100 01 0 0111101111 orthography for 00011 age or cuch
author, with the exception 01 occasional variation in a
few forms, which, like aad 01111100 111 English, 0011
be proved 10 have stood side by side. The couven-
ience 01 0101101110 has been consulted in indicatingi
omnesaue aud 0 consonans by the characters 'so long
appropriated to that purpose.

In 111οΝ0100 it has been my aim, as it was in my
editions 01 Ηο1000 and Virgil, 10 give such aid as 10
most necessary and most 1100101 101 0101101110 1110111
collegas and schools. Credit is given 10 various
scholare whose labcrs have been helpful. Two 01
these deservo special ackncwlcdgment,-Weissenborn,
101 his commentary cn all the books, and Sceley 101
his notesco the First. Professor Seeley's “His-
torical Examination 01 Book First'' deservas 1110
00101111 study of every scholar. Ihave appended 10
this edition the page and 011011 in which he sums up
1110100011 01 his examinatior, trusting that many
who read it will be induoed 10 follow its able author

iu the exhaustive investigation by which he arrives

at these conclusione.
