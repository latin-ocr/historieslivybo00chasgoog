LIVY ΛΝΒ HIS HISTORY OF ROME.

-οὶκςοο-

Inus LIVIUS was e few years younger than Virgil and Horaoe,
but older than Propertius and Ovid, with whom he shines in the
brilliant oonstellation oi genius whiob adorns the Augustan age. He
was born probably in the year tt or 57 Β. 0., at Patavium, now Padus,
which in his day was e populous and wealthy oity, while lamed at the
sometime ior striotness oi morale. Livy was probably oi an equestrien
family3 bred and living in that middle rank whiob is so lavorable ior
the development os ohareeter and talent. There is some reason tn
believe that he was a teaoher oi rhetorio. He wrote books on philoso-
phy, and also dialogues, partly historioal and partly philosophioal. He
enjoyed the friendsbip of Augustus, and it was his oonnsel whieh
indnoed the emperor's grandson, meudina-who wae afterwards
emperor,-to apply his attention to the wrlting of historioal works.
An instanoe ol Livy's oelebrity is mentioned by Pliny (Epist. ii. 3),
who tells us that a Spaniard travelled irom Gades to Rome solely fos
the purpose oi seeing the author ol the great Roman history, and
returned ae soon es he bad satisfied his ouriosity. 'lhe historian died
in his native oity, A. D. ll.

The first deoad (or ten books) oi Livy's ‘⁴ oolossal history ’³ appears
to have been written between the years 2⁷ and 2⁰ Β. (l. rlbe whole
work ooneisted, it hae been supposed, of one hundred and sortytwo
books, oovering the whole period from the foundation of the oity till the
year 9 Β. O.; but Niebuhr suggests thet the author probably intended
to complete fifteen deoads, but died before he oould aooomplish his
objeot. “His purpose in undertaking it was to draw, with all the
oharms whiob his artistio ekill and delioate taste oould give, a oomplete
picture oi the history oi the Roman people, and os the laudable or
hlameworthy peouliarities oi ite prominent personages, that he might
inflame tbe patriotio feelings oi his oountrymen, and oontribute to the
instruction and entertainment oi the world at large. ¹Livy generally
looks at an historioel event or oharaoter from a nsoral point of view:
he wishes to exoite our admiration oi the great, love oi the good, and
