hetred of the bad; he feels a proud pleasure in deeoribing the power
of the Romans, or the purity of manners by whloh they were at first
distinguished; and the history of the eerly ages of the state seems ιο
have eonsoled hirn for the winkedness end wretohednees whioh hebed
seen and felt during the oivil ware. His oonservatirm, und habitual
admiration of the olden times above the modern, merely beoanse they
were the olden times, are exhibited in the early parte of his work,
especially in his description of the οοοιοειε between the petrioiene and
plebeiani. Livy’e partiality to the petrioians mey well be blamed; his
eonservatism, however, never led him to winlr at ernelty or basenens,
or to eonoenl or lrnowingly misetete feote.” 'frnth he held es ο reored
thing. Δι the same time he was etrangely wanting in thet oureful,
laborions reeearoh, and that skill in weighing end sifting evidenoe,
whieh are among the foremost requisites of the historian. He took
euoh materiale ae name ιο hand, founding himself especially upon the
annalists, eontenting himself with purging them of their absurdities,
and arranging their best matter in en attraotive form. Where they
disagreed, he endeavored to deoide between them “with the judgment
of a man of senee,'’ but not hy any well-aseertained philosophiae!
principles of historieal oritieism. “ However turbid the current of hie
information, in no ease did he ever dream of aseending ιο the fountain·
head. He never attempted ιο ιοει the uoouraoy of the sesentiens of
others by examining anoient monuments, or investigating the an-
tiquities of the various Italian tribes.” He seems, moreover, ιο have
performed his taek pieoemenl, without taking a broad and eomprehen-
sive view of his whole subject. In the history of the kings, he followed
Ennius. With Polybius he was uneoquninted until after he had re-
lated the first half of the Punie war3 throughout the fourth deusd
however, he adheres very olosely ιο thet “inoomparable” authority.
Of the details of the geography even of his own eountry, he betrays a
singular ignoranoe, whioh greatly impeirs the value of his narrative.
In a simply literary point of view, however, hivy'e oomposition is
almost faultless. His narrative ‘⁴ flows on in a ealrn but strong onrrent,
oleer and eparlrling but deep and unbrohen; the dietion displeys rieh-
nese without heavinese, and simplieity without tameness. Nor is his
art as a painter less wonderful. There is a distinotness of outline and
a wermth of eoloring in all his delineatione, whether of living men in
aetion, or of things inanimato, whieh never fail ιο oall up the whole ’

εοοοο, with all its eufinnots, before our eyee.'’ Upon the whole, look-
ing at the work both in its external and internal ohareeteristios, we
may well say ιο studente of Livy, in the words of Niebuhr (brutum i.
