x LIVY AND HIS HISTORY OF ROME.

296), “Yoo cunnos stady his soor-Ie ιοο sarach, tort as scholare, aad as
men who escle aad loos slas which s's beaats'flsl. His faults, sshioh we
oannot deny, are lilse the saults oi a bosom friend, which sse must know
bnt towards whieh sse ought not ιο be unjust, and whioh ought not to
distnrb our leelings.'' The first book, and some portions oi the seeond
Punio war, are, in Niebuhr's jndgment, the most beautiful portione oi
the whole work.

Uniortnnately, the larges part oi this great history is no longer
extant. We have the first, third, and fourth deesds, andhuli oi the
fifth, -thirty-five books, —with a fragment oi bools ninsty-first. We
possess, however, summaries oi all the boolss but two, whioh, though
dry and meagre, are yet valuable as in some instanees our sole authori·

she peonliarities ol* Liwy's style, as distinguished from Gioero and
(laesas, are grouped by Grysar under the following heads: l. Freer
ussol words. 2. Poetiediotion. 3. Peonliaritiesoi syntax. 4. Gre-
elsms. 5. Belder construetione. t. Strueture oi the sentenee. 1.
Taking materiale from old ohsonieles and (in tha history os the iringa)
from Ennius, he easily adopted their iorms of expressions henos
archaisms and sometimes pleonasm. 2. Ddderleln ealls Livy an imita-
tor οι Virgi13 and eertainly he uses many words whieh, while found
in the poets, ase never met with in the older prose writers. The poesie
cotoriaq ol his style appears also in the use οι· simple verbs ioreom·
ponnd, in his fondness ior the neuter adjeetive as substantive both with
and without an added genitive, in various poetioal oonstruetions (ss
quid torres loquor, instead oi deterritus), and in the frequeney with
wbieh he introduoes tropea and metaphors. 3. Itis apeenliasity ol*
Livy’s syntax to nse the genitive with the verb sam ιο signity partiei-
pation in something, or that ιο whieh anything serves. The latter idea
he often expresses by the dative of the gerundivo. His usa oi the
dative instead of the ablativo with a or of the aoensative with od, is
not particularly frequent. The neuter oi the perfeet passive partieiple
often stands alone in Livy in the ablativo absolute. The aoristie use
ol the perfect indieative instead oi the pluperseet, and oi the perieot
san'unetise instead oi the imperfect, is eommon to Livy, Nepos,
Sallust, Taeitns, and other historiens. More exeeptional is Livy's lie-

quent use oi the infinitivo instead of the subJunotive, not only in in· '

direet questions, but also in the oratio oblique. This use, however, is
eonflned ιο passages in orations wbieh Livy puts in the mouth oi
another person. lle uses sometimes the infinitivo lor the gerund, par-
ticularly aiter tempas, occasio, resalium. 'l'he oonstruetton of the par·
